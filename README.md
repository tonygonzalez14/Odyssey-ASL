# Odyssey-ASL: 3D CNN for Video Classification
## Description
This project implements a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) for video classification using PyTorch. 
The model is trained on a custom dataset with preprocessed video data. It performs multi-class classification 
of videos into categories such as gestures, actions, or objects.
## Features
- Dynamic dataset handling with automatic class detection.
- Pretrained 3D ResNet-18 model fine-tuned for video classification.
- Video preprocessing with resizing, normalization, and tensor creation.
- Training, validation, and testing loops with accuracy and loss tracking.
- Confusion matrix and classification report for performance evaluation.
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended for faster training)
- Virtual environment (recommended for dependency isolation)
## Data Preparation
- Use the Google Drive to download this root folder named "videos_5". This root folder is used for dataset training and place it in the same folder.
- Besides, it also have the demo videos named "3_classes_asl_test.mp4". This is showed how the model is detected through 3 classes.
